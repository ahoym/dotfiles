## Gap vs Inconsistency Boundary

When a skill identifies documentation issues, define "gaps" and "inconsistencies" with a clear, non-overlapping boundary:

- **Gap** — Docs don't mention something at all. The code has a pattern/feature/system completely absent from documentation.
- **Inconsistency** — Docs exist but contradict the code. The doc says X, the code does Y.

**Pattern:** In skill instructions, include a preamble for each category:
- Gaps section: "Do NOT include items where docs exist but contradict the code; those belong in inconsistencies."
- Inconsistencies section: "Do NOT duplicate items from the gaps section."

## Exploration Skills Should Default to Report-Only

Skills that analyze, explore, or audit a codebase should produce reports but NOT offer to apply fixes or edit documentation. Separating "understand" from "fix" keeps each phase focused, simplifies skill design (no edit logic or conflict handling), and lets users review findings before deciding what to act on.

**Pattern:**
- Skill produces output files and prints a console summary
- Skill ends — no `AskUserQuestion` for "which fixes to apply"
- If the user wants fixes, they initiate that as a separate task

## Stateful Mode Detection via File Existence

A single skill can operate in different modes across invocations by checking what output files already exist on disk, rather than requiring separate skills for each phase.

**Pattern:**
1. On invocation, glob for expected output files
2. For each file found, read its metadata header (commit hash, date) to check staleness
3. Determine mode based on file state:
   - Missing files → run the scan/generation phase for those files
   - All files present, no synthesized output → run synthesis
   - All present + synthesized, but stale → re-scan stale files
   - Everything current → nothing to do

One command to remember, fresh context per invocation, graceful degradation (if 3 of 7 agents fail, next run picks up only the missing 3), and incremental updates. For staleness detection beyond naive commit comparison, see `explore-repo.md` § Diff-Based Staleness Detection.

## Skills Should Self-Document Permission Needs

Skills that read or write files outside the project directory should include a **Prerequisites** section listing the exact `permissions.allow` patterns needed for prompt-free execution. Permission rule syntax is non-obvious (see `claude-code.md` § "Permission Rules" for details like `Read()` covering Glob/Grep).

**Pattern:** Add a `## Prerequisites` section to SKILL.md with a JSON snippet:
```markdown
## Prerequisites

For prompt-free execution, add these allow patterns to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

\```json
"Read(~/.claude/learnings/**)",
"Edit(~/.claude/learnings/**)"
\```
```

## Compose Skills, Don't Couple Them

When two skills share setup (e.g., locating a project, reading files) but diverge in purpose (one exploratory, one operational), keep them separate and composable. Duplicate the shared setup in each skill (~10 lines of instructions is fine) rather than making one depend on the other. Add a hint in the operational skill pointing to the exploratory one for users who need context first. Example: `/ralph:resume` mentions `/ralph:brief` but doesn't invoke it — the user composes them when needed.

## Merging Diverged Skills Across Repos

When two repos have independently evolved the same skill, merge by keeping unique features from both sides. Use the more complete version as the base, append unique sections from the other. For platform-specific commands (gh vs glab), parameterize via a shared reference file with detection logic and a mapping table. One codebase to maintain means no future drift.

**When to unify vs keep separate:** Unify when the workflow is shared and only the plumbing differs (CLI commands, API field names, terminology). Keep separate when the workflows themselves diverge — different steps, decision points, or user interactions with no equivalent on the other platform.

## Skill Improvement: Fix and Assess In-Session

Apply skill improvements in the same session they surface — context fades across sessions. After running a skill, note what worked, what didn't, and prioritize: regression prevention >> efficiency; one-line fixes >> structural overhauls. Cap at 3-5 improvements. If a skill hits a bug mid-execution, fix immediately — scope to one constraint workaround per incident.

## AskUserQuestion Has a 4-Option Maximum

`AskUserQuestion` enforces `maxItems: 4` on the options array. This is a hard schema constraint — not configurable. Skills that present learnings, tasks, or choices to the user will fail at runtime if they try to offer >4 options.

**Workarounds (in order of preference):**
1. **Auto-save high-confidence items** — Remove them from the selection set entirely. Only prompt for uncertain items, which usually fit in 4 options.
2. **Group by theme** — Combine related items into a single option (e.g., "CI patterns (3 items)" instead of 3 separate options).
3. **Use free-text input** — Present a numbered table and let the user type "1,3,5" or "all" as a regular message instead of using the widget.
4. **Multi-round prompting** — Split into batches of 4, though this adds friction.

**Where this bites:** `/learnings:compound` when a session produces >4 learnings. The fix applied there: auto-save High-utility learnings (they're almost always worth keeping) and only prompt for Medium/Low.

## "LLM Knows X" ≠ "LLM Consistently Applies X"

When deciding whether to codify a pattern, the question isn't "can the model execute this when asked?" but "does it reliably do so unprompted?" Textbook patterns (extract class, DRY, factories) that the model knows but doesn't consistently apply during implementation still warrant codification — as a lightweight checklist reminder, not a tutorial. The correct form factor is a slim reference file (~15 lines) that reminds, not a 229-line reference file that teaches.

## "Reduces Typing" Is Sufficient Justification for a Skill

Don't overthink whether a repeated sequence "deserves" to be a skill. If the user types the same N commands every session in the same order, a skill that runs them sequentially is a valid simplification — even if individual steps are conversational or already invoke other skills. The bar is consistency of the sequence, not complexity of the automation.

## Skill Responsibility Boundaries: Compound, Curate, Retro

Compound = intake (captures new learnings from sessions). Curate = maintenance (reorganizes, prunes, migrates existing learnings). Retro = reflection (surfaces discussion, invokes compound). Changes to *what* gets captured belong in compound. Changes to *how* content is organized belong in curate. Retro orchestrates but doesn't own persistence. When deciding where a system change belongs, trace the data flow: if it's about widening or narrowing the intake aperture, it's compound.

## No Half-Steps in Numbered Instructions

When writing numbered steps in skills or protocols, use proper integer steps (Step 0, 1, 2, 3...), not half-steps (Step 1.5). Half-steps signal the structure wasn't planned upfront, add uncertainty about ordering, and make the sequence harder to reference. If a new step needs to be inserted, renumber all subsequent steps.

## Validating Skill Changes

After modifying or creating skills, verify before committing:
1. **Structure** — Directory exists, old files removed (if migrated)
2. **Content** — Key content present in SKILL.md, reference files linked correctly
3. **Permissions** — Required Bash patterns added to settings.json
4. **Function** — Test the actual commands the skill uses when possible

## Bash Commands in Skills

- Use `--force-with-lease` instead of `--force` for safety
- Include the full command, not just fragments
- Show prerequisite commands (fetch, checkout) explicitly
- Use HEREDOC for multi-line commit messages

## User Interaction Points

Mark steps where user input is needed:
- **Ask for confirmation**: Before destructive operations (force push, reset)
- **Ask for selection**: When multiple paths are possible
- **Show and confirm**: Before committing or pushing

## File Operations in Skills

Keep temp files within repo scope rather than system directories:
- **Use `./tmp/`** instead of `/tmp/` for skill-generated files
- Add `tmp/` to `.gitignore`
- Create the directory with `mkdir -p ./tmp` before use

This keeps operations contained to the repo context and avoids permission issues.

## Making Skills Portable

Skills should work across different projects. Periodically audit skills to remove project-specific content.

| Project-Specific | Generic Replacement |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Class names from your codebase | Domain-neutral names (`DataProcessor`, `BatchProcessor`) |
| File paths from your project | Generic paths (`pipeline.py`, `src/models/`) |
| Internal API names | Generic references (`External API`, `Payment API`) |

**Audit process:** Search skills for project-specific class/file names → check SKILL.md and reference files → replace with domain-neutral examples → verify examples still make sense generically.
