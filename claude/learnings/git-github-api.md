## GitHub API Pagination Hides Newest Comments

The GitHub PR comments endpoint defaults to `per_page=30` ascending — when a PR has 30+ comments, newer ones silently fall off the first page. Incremental polling that doesn't account for this misses new reviewer comments entirely.

**Fix:** Use `direction=desc` for incremental fetches (newest first, always visible within default page size). Use `--paginate` for full fetches (auto-fetches all pages). Same applies to the issues comments endpoint.

## GitHub Reviews Endpoint Has No `since` Filter

The `gh pr view --json reviews` endpoint returns all reviews every time — it doesn't support `since` or `updated_after` filtering. To detect new review submissions on incremental fetches, track `LAST_REVIEW_COUNT` and compare against the current count. Only process reviews beyond the previous count. This is distinct from inline comments and issue comments, which support timestamp-based filtering.

## Bulk PR Content Extraction Without Checkout

Use `git fetch origin <branch>` + `git show origin/<branch>:<path>` to extract files from unmerged PR branches without checkout. Prefix output files with `pr{N}-` to avoid collisions when multiple PRs touch the same filename.

```bash
for pr in 2 3 4 5; do
  branch=$(gh pr view $pr --json headRefName -q .headRefName)
  git fetch origin "$branch" --quiet
  git show "origin/$branch:docs/topic.md" > "pr${pr}-topic.md"
done
```

**Why this over merging:** Avoids merge conflicts between branches, works with stale branches, and lets downstream tools handle deduplication. Clean up after with `gh pr close $pr --comment "Content extracted." --delete-branch`.

## Fixing Misordered Stacked PR Branches

When stacked PR branches were created in the wrong order (dependent branches created before dependency commits), the fix is straightforward:

1. **Reset** the branch to the correct dependency: `git branch -f <broken-branch> <correct-base>`
2. **Worktree** to avoid disturbing the working tree: `git worktree add /tmp/fix-<name> <broken-branch>`
3. **Copy** the agent's own files from the working tree into the worktree
4. **Commit and force-push**: `git -C /tmp/fix-<name> add -A && git -C /tmp/fix-<name> commit && git -C /tmp/fix-<name> push --force`
5. **Clean up**: `git worktree remove /tmp/fix-<name>`

**Key principle:** Each branch should only contain its own agent's files. Don't bundle dependency files into the commit — let the branch ancestry provide them. CI will fail until upstream PRs merge, which is expected and documented in the PR description.

**Process in topological order** — fix dependency branches before dependent ones, since dependent branches use the fixed dependency as their base.

## Stacked PR Dependency Risks

Stacked PRs compound risk: parallel work can make dependent PRs redundant before the chain resolves. When a branch carries its dependency's changes, it becomes stale if the dependency merges with a different implementation. Keep stacked branches minimal — don't carry parent changes forward; let branch ancestry provide them.

## Cascade Rebase for Stacked Branches

- `checkout -B` resets local to remote, then rebase on updated base; `--force-with-lease` for safe push
- After rebasing stacked branches, retarget: `glab mr update <N> --target-branch <new-base>` (GitLab) / `gh pr edit <N> --base <new-base>` (GitHub)
- `checkout -B` is safer than `checkout` for stacked workflows — avoids stale local state

## PR Inline Comment Reply Endpoint

Reply to an inline review comment with `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments` using `-F in_reply_to=<comment_id>`. The endpoint `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{id}/replies` does **not** exist (returns 404).

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments \
  -f body="reply text" \
  -F in_reply_to=<comment_id>
```
