# Component Architecture Guideline

## Large Pages: Decompose into Sub-Components with Shared Hooks

When a page component grows beyond ~200 lines, decompose it into:

1. **Slim orchestrator page** (~100-150 lines) — owns top-level state, wires props between sections
2. **Sub-components** in a dedicated subdirectory — each manages its own submission/loading/error state
3. **Shared hooks** — extract repeated data-fetching and action patterns

### Pattern

```
app/
  some-feature/
    page.tsx              <- Slim orchestrator (state, layout, wiring)
  components/
    some-feature/
      form-a.tsx          <- Self-contained form with own submit state
      list-b.tsx          <- Self-contained list with own loading state
      detail-c.tsx        <- Self-contained detail view
lib/
  hooks/
    use-some-data.ts      <- Shared fetch hook (address, network) -> { data, loading, refresh }
    use-some-action.ts    <- Shared action hook () -> { loading, error, execute }
```

### Rules

- **Each sub-component owns its action state** (loading, error for its own POST calls). The orchestrator doesn't need to know about submission details.
- **Shared hooks own fetch state** (data, loading, refresh). Multiple components can consume the same hook independently.
- **The orchestrator provides context** (wallet addresses, network, callbacks for cross-component refresh).
- **Refresh coordination**: Pass `refreshKey` numbers or `onChanged` callbacks down to trigger sibling refreshes when one component modifies shared data.

### Shared UI Primitives

Before building inline collapsible sections, tab bars, or form submission state, check for existing shared abstractions:

- **CollapsibleSection** — toggleable section with chevron; use instead of hand-rolled `collapsed` state + click handler
- **TabBar<T>** — generic typed tab navigation; use instead of hand-rolled tab buttons with active-class logic
- **useFormSubmit<T>** — form submission state machine (submitting/error/success + auto-clear); use instead of hand-rolled `useState` + `try/catch` + `setTimeout`
- **Button classes** — shared Tailwind class constants; use instead of inline Tailwind for action buttons

### When NOT to Extract

- Don't extract a hook for a one-off action unique to a single component
- Don't extract a sub-component for a section that's < 50 lines
- Don't extract a shared hook if only one consumer exists (extract when a second consumer appears)
