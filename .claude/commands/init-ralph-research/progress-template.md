## State
Last updated: (not started)
Current iteration: 0
Status: NOT_STARTED

## Completed Tasks
(none yet)

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Research & Document - Learn about <TOPIC>, document findings, and identify areas for deeper investigation
- [ ] Codebase Summary - Review relevant repository code and create summary
- [ ] Assumptions & Questions - Log questions and assumptions from documentation work
- [ ] Implementation Plan - Create phased implementation plan

<!--
Dynamic tasks will be added here as research progresses, e.g.:
- [ ] Deep Research: <topic> - <description>

Deep Research creates separate files (e.g., topic.md) with cross-references.
See spec.md "Deep Research Workflow" section for details.
-->

## Questions Requiring User Input
<!--
REQUIRED before completion. Add genuine blocking questions here:
- What decisions require human judgment?
- What information is missing that only the user can provide?
- What trade-offs need user input to resolve?

If this section is empty, you haven't gone deep enough. Add more research tasks.
-->
(none yet - will be populated as research progresses)

## Notes for Next Iteration
- This is a fresh project. Start with the first pending task.
- After completing research tasks, review findings and add deep research tasks for areas needing investigation.
- **Deep Research workflow**: Create separate `<topic>.md` files, update cross-references in info.md, update implementation-plan.md and assumptions-and-questions.md with learnings.
- The loop should cycle: Research → Deep Research → Update cross-references → Discover more areas → repeat until stop criteria met.
- Do not mark complete until you genuinely cannot proceed without user input.
