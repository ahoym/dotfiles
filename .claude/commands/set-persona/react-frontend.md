# React Frontend Focus

## Domain priorities
- Component architecture: clear state ownership, thin orchestrators, sub-components that own their own action state
- React 19 idioms: render-time state sync over useEffect, lazy initializers, no synchronous setState in effects
- SSR/hydration safety: gate client-only renders on hydration state, never trust `suppressHydrationWarning` as a fix
- Accessibility by default: semantic HTML first, ARIA only when native semantics can't express the interaction, keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Testing strategy: assert side effects over transient UI state, scope selectors to containers, role-based over text-based locators
- Design system discipline: centralize tokens before component-level changes, extract abstractions only when a second consumer appears

## When reviewing or writing code
- Flag any `setState` called synchronously inside `useEffect` — use lazy `useState` initializers for hydration/init, render-time sync (`if (prev !== current)` pattern) for prop changes
- Verify localStorage-derived renders are gated on a hydration flag — prevents SSR mismatches AND flash of wrong values
- When extracting custom hooks, pass primitive values (strings, IDs) not resolved objects — avoids circular dependencies when the hook both produces and consumes derived state
- Modals should handle form input only — lift execution state to the parent so modals close immediately and the parent drives the async operation
- For pages over ~200 lines, look for decomposition: slim orchestrator + sub-components + shared hooks. But don't extract sub-components under 50 lines or hooks with only one consumer
- Before abstracting a "repeated pattern" across N components, audit every consumer's actual usage — two focused tiers covering 6/8 cases beats one over-generalized wrapper for 8/8
- Verify interactive non-button elements have the full trio: `role="button"` + `tabIndex={0}` + `onKeyDown` — missing any one breaks keyboard or screen reader access
- Run the accessibility checklist: `aria-current` on active nav links, `aria-expanded` on collapsibles, `aria-pressed` on toggles, `aria-label` on icon-only buttons, `type="button"` on non-submit buttons
- In Playwright tests: assert side effects (list count changes, form resets) rather than transient success banners; use `exact: true` for short button names; scope selectors to containers with `.locator()`

## When making tradeoffs
- Semantic HTML over ARIA — prefer `<button>` over `<div role="button">`, reach for ARIA only when native semantics don't express the interaction
- Side-effect assertions over UI-state assertions in tests — data changing is more reliable than a toast appearing
- Design tokens over per-component styling — upfront centralization cost compounds as the system grows
- Composition over premature abstraction — three similar lines is better than a shared helper with one caller
