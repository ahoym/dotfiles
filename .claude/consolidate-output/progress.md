## Notes for Next Iteration

<!-- Appended each iteration with ### Iter N heading — do not overwrite -->

### Iter 1

**Methodology loaded (first invocation):**
- 6-bucket classification model: Skill candidate, Template for skill, Context for skill, Guideline candidate, Standalone reference, Outdated
- Confidence levels: HIGH (auto-apply), MEDIUM (judge autonomously), LOW (record for review)
- Persona criteria: 3+ files, 8+ patterns, judgment-grade content (not just gotchas)
- Lean personas: judgment layer only, knowledge in learnings files with Detailed references
- Context cost: prefer conditional references over @-imports for non-universal content
- Compression targets: provenance notes, self-assessments, debugging trails, verbose code, stale numbers
- Migration litmus test: "Would having this in the target actually change how I execute?"

**LEARNINGS sweep findings:**
- 34 files, ~180 patterns, 14 clusters. Well-organized corpus with good persona coverage.
- 2 MEDIUMs applied (reference wiring): bash-patterns→platform-engineer, code-quality-instincts→react-frontend
- No HIGHs, no LOWs. No exact duplicates found via H2/H3 collision detection.
- No thin fold-and-delete candidates. No stale content detected.
- No persona creation opportunities (Python has only 1 file/3 patterns).
- Deep-dive tracker run_count incremented 4→5.

**Polish Opportunities (quality scan, no action taken):**
- skill-design.md (231L) and skill-platform-portability.md (220L) are the largest files but both thematically unified with explicit navigation header.
- ralph-loop.md (184L, ~25 patterns) — large but single-topic, correctly sized.
- playwright-patterns.md (225L, 17 patterns) — large but thematically unified with numbered patterns.

### Iter 2

**SKILLS sweep findings:**
- 29 skills across 5 namespace clusters + standalone. 7 personas (3 extend platform-engineer). 5 shared skill-references.
- All reference files verified present. All Co-Authored-By strings use current model (Claude Opus 4.6).
- No overlap, merge, split, or prune candidates. No stale references.
- Cross-persona check: xrpl-typescript-fullstack + react-frontend share Next.js 16 pointer — intentional (different detail levels, same target learning). LOW.
- Clean sweep — no actions taken.

### Iter 3

**GUIDELINES sweep findings:**
- 3 files (communication.md 115L, context-aware-learnings.md 82L, skill-invocation.md 8L), all @-referenced in CLAUDE.md.
- All universally applicable behavioral guidelines — correct content type, appropriate for always-on.
- No overlap with learnings, personas, or skill-references (grep-verified).
- No compression opportunity ≥30% threshold.
- No unreferenced guidelines, no domain-specific content to migrate, no reference material misplaced as guideline.
- Clean sweep — no actions taken.

**Round 1 complete**: L(0H/2M) + S(0H/0M) + G(0H/0M) = not clean → CLEAN_ROUND_STREAK stays 0. Starting Round 2.

### Iter 4

**LEARNINGS sweep (Round 2) findings:**
- 34 files, ~14 clusters. Same file count as sweep 1.
- H2/H3 heading collision check: no duplicates across files.
- Sweep 1 reference wiring verified: bash-patterns→platform-engineer (line 64), code-quality-instincts→react-frontend (line 49) both present and correct.
- No exact duplicates, no partial overlaps, no thin fold candidates, no stale content, no genericization candidates, no compression candidates ≥30%.
- Unreferenced learnings (18 files) are all meta-tooling without matching personas — no wiring opportunity.
- code-quality-instincts.md (15L) confirmed correctly sized as shared cross-persona reference.
- No merge/split opportunities (large files are thematically unified).
- Clean sweep — no actions taken.

**Deep dive candidates (recording for convergence)**:
DEEP_DIVE_CANDIDATES: [code-quality-instincts.md (hub: 2 persona refs), react-patterns.md (hub: 2 persona refs), nextjs.md (hub: 2 persona refs), xrpl-typescript-fullstack.md (tracker: last=0), react-frontend.md (tracker: last=0), platform-engineer.md (tracker: last=0), explore-repo.md (tracker: last=0), skill-platform-portability.md (stale: 5-1=4≥3)]
Fill needed: 2 more to reach min_deep_dives=10. Priority: untracked corpus files (18 learnings untracked).

### Iter 5

**SKILLS sweep (Round 2) findings:**
- 29 skills, 5 namespace clusters + standalone. 7 personas (3 extend platform-engineer). 5 shared skill-references.
- All Co-Authored-By strings verified current (Claude Opus 4.6). No stale model references.
- No changes to skills corpus since sweep 2 — no new overlap, merge, split, or prune candidates.
- Cross-persona content-level dedup: java-backend/java-devops/java-infosec clearly distinct domains. Extension pattern (java-devops→platform-engineer, typescript-devops→platform-engineer) clean, no duplicated gotchas.
- xrpl-typescript-fullstack + react-frontend Next.js pointer overlap confirmed intentional (same LOW from sweep 2).
- Clean sweep — no actions taken.

### Iter 6

**GUIDELINES sweep (Round 2) findings:**
- 3 files (communication.md 115L, context-aware-learnings.md 82L, skill-invocation.md 8L), all @-referenced.
- No corpus changes since iter 3's clean GUIDELINES sweep. No learnings/skills/persona changes creating new overlaps (iters 4-5 clean).
- Clean sweep — no actions taken.

**Round 2 complete**: L(0H/0M) + S(0H/0M) + G(0H/0M) = clean → CLEAN_ROUND_STREAK 0→1. Starting Round 3.

### Iter 7

**LEARNINGS sweep (Round 3) findings:**
- 34 files, ~325 H2 sections, ~14 clusters. Same file count and structure as Round 2.
- H2/H3 heading collision check: no duplicates across files.
- All persona Detailed references verified intact (bash-patterns→platform-engineer, code-quality-instincts→react-frontend+xrpl-typescript-fullstack).
- No duplicates, partial overlaps, thin fold candidates, stale content, genericization candidates, or compression candidates.
- Unreferenced learnings (18 files) remain meta-tooling without matching personas.
- Clean sweep — no actions taken.

**Deep dive candidates confirmed (same as iter 4):**
DEEP_DIVE_CANDIDATES: [code-quality-instincts.md (hub: 2 persona refs), react-patterns.md (hub: 2 persona refs), nextjs.md (hub: 2 persona refs), skill-platform-portability.md (stale: 5-1=4>=3), xrpl-typescript-fullstack.md (tracker: last=0), react-frontend.md (tracker: last=0), platform-engineer.md (tracker: last=0), explore-repo.md (tracker: last=0), cross-repo-sync.md (fill: untracked), git-patterns.md (fill: untracked)]

### Iter 8

**SKILLS sweep (Round 3) findings:**
- 29 skills, 7 personas, 5 skill-references. Same counts as sweep 5.
- No corpus changes since sweep 5 (iters 6-7 were clean GUIDELINES and LEARNINGS sweeps).
- Clean sweep — no actions taken.

### Iter 9

**GUIDELINES sweep (Round 3) findings:**
- 3 files (communication.md 115L, context-aware-learnings.md 82L, skill-invocation.md 8L), all @-referenced.
- No corpus changes since iter 6's clean GUIDELINES sweep (iters 7-8 clean).
- Clean sweep — no actions taken.

**Round 3 complete**: L(0H/0M) + S(0H/0M) + G(0H/0M) = clean → CLEAN_ROUND_STREAK 1→2 → **CONVERGENCE REACHED**.

**Transitioning to DEEP_DIVE phase.** 10 candidates (= min_deep_dives):
- Hub files (3): code-quality-instincts.md, react-patterns.md, nextjs.md
- Stale tracked (4): skill-platform-portability.md (4 runs overdue), xrpl-typescript-fullstack.md (5), react-frontend.md (5), platform-engineer.md (5), explore-repo.md (5)
- Fill (2): cross-repo-sync.md, git-patterns.md (untracked)

**Prioritization**: Hub files first (cross-reference verification most valuable), then stale tracked by overdue count descending, then fill.
