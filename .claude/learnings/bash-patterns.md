# Bash Patterns

## Shell Env Default Ordering Gotcha

When a shared library script (e.g., `lib.sh`) sets a variable with a default:
```bash
# lib.sh
export NETWORK="${NETWORK:-testnet}"
```

Any downstream script that sources it **cannot** override with another conditional default:
```bash
source lib.sh            # NETWORK is now "testnet"
NETWORK="${NETWORK:-$STATE_NETWORK}"  # No-op! NETWORK is already set
```

**Fix:** Save the user's original value before sourcing the library:
```bash
USER_NETWORK="${NETWORK:-}"
source lib.sh
if [ "${USER_NETWORK:-}" = "" ]; then
  NETWORK="$STATE_NETWORK"  # Use data-driven default
fi
```

This preserves explicit user overrides (`NETWORK=mainnet ./script.sh`) while allowing the script to use a data-driven default (e.g., from a state file) instead of the library's hardcoded default.
