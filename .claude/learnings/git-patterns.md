## Commit-Message-Based Identification for Rebase

When you need to find and drop a specific commit during rebase, use a known commit message instead of positional logic (`tail -1`, `head -1`):

```bash
MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)
SKILLS_COMMIT=$(git log --format="%H %s" "$MERGE_BASE"..HEAD | grep "\[web-session\] sync skills" | awk '{print $1}')
git rebase --onto origin/main "$SKILLS_COMMIT"
```

**Why message-based over positional:**
- Robust against extra commits between merge-base and feature commits
- Works even if someone manually commits on the branch before branching off
- Self-documenting — the grep pattern makes intent clear

**Convention:** Use bracketed prefixes in commit messages (e.g., `[web-session]`) to make them greppable without false positives.
