# Git Patterns

## Commit-Message-Based Identification for Rebase

When you need to find and drop a specific commit during rebase, use a known commit message instead of positional logic (`tail -1`, `head -1`):

```bash
MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)
SKILLS_COMMIT=$(git log --format="%H %s" "$MERGE_BASE"..HEAD | grep "\[web-session\] sync skills" | awk '{print $1}')
git rebase --onto origin/main "$SKILLS_COMMIT"
```

**Why message-based over positional:**
- Robust against extra commits between merge-base and feature commits
- Works even if someone manually commits on the branch before branching off
- Self-documenting — the grep pattern makes intent clear

**Convention:** Use bracketed prefixes in commit messages (e.g., `[web-session]`) to make them greppable without false positives.

## rsync --delete Auto-Removes Renamed Directories

When using `rsync --delete` to sync directories, renaming a source directory (e.g., `git-address-mr-review` → `git-address-pr-review`) automatically deletes the old-named directory from the target. This is because `--delete` removes anything in the target that doesn't exist in the source.

**Implication:** For repo migrations that rename multiple directories (e.g., MR→PR skill renaming), a single rsync with `--delete` handles both copying new dirs and removing old dirs — no need for separate `rm -rf` cleanup commands.

## Fixing Misordered Stacked PR Branches

When stacked PR branches were created in the wrong order (dependent branches created before dependency commits), the fix is straightforward:

1. **Reset** the branch to the correct dependency: `git branch -f <broken-branch> <correct-base>`
2. **Worktree** to avoid disturbing the working tree: `git worktree add /tmp/fix-<name> <broken-branch>`
3. **Copy** the agent's own files from the working tree into the worktree
4. **Commit and force-push**: `git -C /tmp/fix-<name> add -A && git -C /tmp/fix-<name> commit && git -C /tmp/fix-<name> push --force`
5. **Clean up**: `git worktree remove /tmp/fix-<name>`

**Key principle:** Each branch should only contain its own agent's files. Don't bundle dependency files into the commit — let the branch ancestry provide them. CI will fail until upstream PRs merge, which is expected and documented in the PR description.

**Process in topological order** — fix dependency branches before dependent ones, since dependent branches use the fixed dependency as their base.

**Discovered from:** parallel-plan:execute session where 7 of 11 PR branches were based on `main` instead of their dependency branches, causing Vercel CI failures.

## Verify Commit State Before Committing

When `git status` shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean" but you just created/edited files, check whether the changes were already committed (e.g., by hooks or auto-commit):

```bash
git show HEAD:path/to/file
```

If the file contents are already there, the commit already happened. Don't assume changes are lost or that git is confused — check HEAD first.
